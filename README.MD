# animagix-cli

This script aggregation provides the execution of the
argo workflow template which is deposited in the cluster. It will calculate
the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) of your local FASTA-files and returns
the results in JSON and CSV format.
If your files are not already in .tar.gz format, animagix will compress your directory.

## prerequisites:
- bash
- python3 with boto3 installed
```
python -m pip install boto3
```
- argo cli:
